# AI Widget Generator for SEO Engagement

Boost user engagement by adding interactive, content-aware widgets to any article. No sign-up is required.

This script automatically scans your article's content and generates a relevant widget—like a calculator, checklist, or comparison tool—to keep your readers engaged, increase time-on-page, and reduce bounce rate.

## How to Install (60 seconds)

**Step 1: Add the container**

Place this line of HTML code in your article where you want the widget to appear:

`<div data-interaction-container></div>`


**Step 2: Add the script**

Place this script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag on your page:
`<script src="https://widget-handler.pages.dev/interaction_loader.js" async></script>`

That's it. The widget is generated on the first visit to a page (this can take up to 5 minutes). After that, it is cached and loads instantly for all future visitors.
